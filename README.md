Demonstration of Personal Computer and its Accessories 
Demonstration and Explanation on Disassembly and Assembly of a Personal 
Computer by the faculty-in-charge. Students have to prepare a write-up on the 
same and include it in the Lab record and evaluated. 
Laboratory Session-1: Write-up on Functional block diagram of Computer, CPU, Buses, 
Mother Board, Chip sets, Operating System & types of OS, Basics of Networking & 
Topology and NIC. 
Laboratory Session-2: Write-up on RAM, SDRAM, FLASH memory, Hard disks, Optical 
media, CD-ROM/R/RW, DVDs, Flash drives, Keyboard, Mouse, Printers and Plotters. 
Introduction to flowchart, algorithm and pseudo code. 
Note: These TWO Laboratory sessions are used to fill the gap between theory classes and 
practical sessions. Both sessions are evaluated as lab experiments. 
Laboratory Experiments 
Implement the programs with WINDOWS / LINUX platform using appropriate C 
compiler. 


1. Design and develop a flowchart or an algorithm that takes three coefficients (a, b, and c) 
of a Quadratic equation (
ax2+bx+c=0) as input and compute all possible roots. Implement 
a C program for the developed flowchart/algorithm and execute the same to output the 
possible roots for a given set of coefficients with appropriate messages. 

2. Design and develop an algorithm to find the reverse of an integer number NUM and 
check whether it is PALINDROME or NOT. Implement a C program for the developed 
algorithm that takes an integer number as input and output the reverse of the same 
with suitable messages. Ex: Num: 2014, Reverse: 4102, Not a Palindrome 


3a. Design and develop a flowchart to find the square root of a given number N. 
Implement a C program for the same and execute for all possible inputs with 
appropriate messages. Note: Don’t use library function sqrt(n). 

3b. Design and develop a C program to read a year as an input and find whether it is leap 
year or not. Also consider end of the centuries. 2 

4. Design and develop an algorithm to evaluate polynomial f(x) = a4x
4 + a3x
3 + a2x
2 + a1x+a0, for a given value of x and its coefficients using Horner’s method. Implement a C 
program for the same and execute the program with different set of values of coefficients and x.

5. Draw the flowchart and Write a C Program to compute Sin(x) using Taylor series 
approximation given by 
 LOOK AT THE SYLLABUS COPY :P 
Compare your result with the built- in Library function. Print both the results with 
appropriate messages. 

6. Develop an algorithm, implement and execute a C program that reads N integer numbers 
and arrange them in ascending order using Bubble Sort. 

7. Develop, implement and execute a C program that reads two matrices A (m x n ) 
and B (p x q ) and Compute product of matrices A and B. Read matrix A and matrix B
in row major order and in column major order respectively. Print both the input matrices 
and resultant matrix with suitable headings and output should be in matrix format only. 
Program must check the compatibility of orders of the matrices for multiplication. 
Report appropriate message in case of incompatibility. 

8. Develop, implement and execute a C program to search a Name in a list of names using 
Binary searching Technique.

9a. Write and execute a C program that 
Implements string copy operation STRCOPY(str1,str2) that copies a string 
str1 to another string str2 without using library function. 

9b. Read a sentence and print frequency of vowels and total count of consonants. 

10a. Design and develop a C function RightShift(x ,n) that takes two integers x and n
as input and returns value of the integer x rotated to the right by n positions. Assume 
the integers are unsigned. Write a C program that invokes this function with different 
values for x and n and tabulate the results with suitable headings. 

10b. Design and develop a C function isprime(num) that accepts an integer argument 
and returns 1 if the argument is prime, a 0 otherwise. Write a C program that invokes 
this function to generate prime numbers between the given range. 


11. Draw the flowchart and write a recursive C function to find the factorial of a number, 
n!, defined by fact(n)=1, if n=0. Otherwise fact(n)=n*fact(n-1). Using this function, 
write a C program to compute the binomial coefficient nCr. Tabulate the results for 
different values of n and r with suitable messages. 3 


12. Given two university information files “studentname.txt” and “usn.txt” that contains 
students Name and USN respectively. Write a C program to create a new file called 
“output.txt” and copy the content of files “studentname.txt” and “usn.txt” into output 
file in the sequence shown below . Display the contents of output file “output.txt” on to 
the screen. 


13. Write a C program to maintain a record of n student details using an array of structures 
with four fields (Roll number, Name, Marks, and Grade). Assume appropriate data type 
for each field. Print the marks of the student, given the student name as input. 


14. Write a C program using pointers to compute the sum, mean and standard deviation of all 
elements stored in an array of n real numbers. 


Practical Examination Procedure:
1 . All laboratory experiments (FOURTEEN) are to be included for practical 
examination. 
2 . Students are allowed to pick one experiment from the lot. 
3 . Strictly follow the instructions as printed on the cover page of answer script for 
breakup of marks 
4 . Change of experiment is allowed only once and 15% Marks allotted to the 
procedure part to be made zero.
